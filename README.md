Fuzzy-find any file or directory anywhere under a root (default: your home
folder) from inside Obsidian, preview it, and then **insert** its path at the
cursor or **open** the entry — as a note in Obsidian, or in your OS's default app.

## Why

For me, dropping a real filesystem path into a note normally means:

1. Open a terminal,
2. Fuzzy-find the directory,
3. Copy the path,
4. Switch back,
5. Paste.

Path Picker does the fuzzy-find in a modal and drops the result where your cursor already is — or opens the entry on the spot, no insertion needed — a seamless user experience.
It brings the muscle memory of shell fuzzy finders into the editor, without leaving Obsidian.

## Features

- **Two commands**: _Insert directory path_ and _Insert file path_. (+ a `Tab` toggle to switch mode inside the picker)
- **Live fuzzy match** with highlighted match positions and a moving selection.
- **Preview pane**: a directory tree (depth configurable, default 2), or the head
  of a file with syntax highlighting (using Obsidian's own renderer, so it matches
  your theme). The tree is rainbow-coloured by nesting depth from your theme's
  palette (toggleable in settings).
- **Resizable split**: drag the divider between the results list and the preview
  to find your sweet spot; the position is remembered across sessions
  (double-click the divider to reset it to 50/50).
- **Root switching** (`Ctrl/Cmd+O`): jump to home, the vault root, a recent root (the last 5 are remembered), or type/paste a custom path.
- **Open in place** (`Alt+Enter` / `Alt+click`): open the selection instead of inserting it — in Obsidian when it's a tracked vault entry (note in a new tab, or folder revealed in the File Explorer), otherwise in your OS's default app.
- **Configurable insertion**: a template decides what gets inserted.

On top of that, it has **no external dependencies**, no `fzf`, `eza`, `bat`, or `fd` binaries.
Walking and previews use Node's `fs`; fuzzy matching uses [fzf-for-js](https://github.com/ajitid/fzf-for-js), bundled into the plugin.

## Usage

1. Place your cursor in a note.
2. Run **Path Picker: Insert directory path** (or **…file path**) from the
   command palette, or bind a hotkey under **Settings → Hotkeys**. (If you use
   the [Doubleshift](https://github.com/Qwyntex/doubleshift) plugin, you can map
   shift-shift to either command.)
3. Type to filter; the preview updates as you move the selection.
4. Press **Enter** to insert the path at the cursor.

| Key                       | Action                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `↑` / `↓`                 | Move selection                  |
| `Ctrl+N/P`                | Move selection (readline-style) |
| `Enter`                   | Insert the selected path        |
| `Alt+Enter` / `Alt+click` | Open the selected entry         |
| `Tab`                     | Toggle directory / file mode    |
| `Ctrl/Cmd+O`              | Change the search root          |
| `Esc`                     | Close                           |

**Opening an entry** — `Alt+Enter` (or `Alt+click`) opens the selection instead of
inserting it. A **tracked vault entry** opens in Obsidian: a file opens as a note in
a new tab, a folder is revealed in the File Explorer sidebar. Anything else — outside
the vault, or an untracked in-vault path such as one under a dot-folder (e.g.
`.obsidian/`) — opens in your operating system's default application for that file
type (a directory opens in your file manager).

| Highlight size cap      | `1024` KB         | Files larger than this preview as plain text. `0` disables the limit.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Highlight line cap      | `5000` chars      | Skip highlighting when a line is longer than this (e.g. minified). `0` disables.                                                                                                                                                       |
| Skip directories        | common noise dirs | Comma-separated names pruned while walking. The default covers common VCS, dependency, build-output, and cache folders across ecosystems (e.g. `node_modules`, `.venv`, `__pycache__`, `dist`, `build`, `target`, `vendor`, `.cache`). |

**Insertion template examples**

Below are some examples of how the insertion template works:

| Template           | Inserts                           |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `{path}`           | `/home/you/projects/docs`         |
| `` `{path}` ``     | `` `/home/you/projects/docs` ``   |
| `[{name}]({path})` | `[docs](/home/you/projects/docs)` |

So if you want to insert a Markdown link to the selected file, you can use `[{name}]({path})` as the template.

## Limitations

- Desktop only (Obsidian ≥ 1.4.0).
- File previews are syntax-highlighted via Obsidian's own renderer (your active
  theme's colors). Files with no recognized extension, binaries, and files over
  the configurable size/line caps fall back to plain monospace text.
- The commands require an active editor — they insert at the cursor.
- Tested with Ubuntu & macOS only.
